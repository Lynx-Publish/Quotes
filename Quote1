“What makes you think that you are any more alive than a rock or a plant? All existence is just fundamental physical interactions on an abstractified scale. The very bits of information travelling in your brain are forced into the exact same constraints as those that make up an eroding rock in the woods in vietnam. All things can be thought of as some mixture of physics and chemical interaction stemming from such physics creating a semi-cohesive reality that we seem to stitch together rudimentarily and naively. There is no such thing as a cohesive reality as things are constantly changing, and as our perceptions are constantly changing, yet we mask that with a false created sense of individuality and continuity, once that is created in vain, and error. We have attempted to remove ourselves from this cycle of reality without the true knowledge of what we are discerning ourselves from, and what exactly that entails. Not to say that discerning ourselves within it is truly approachable to begin with as It is a fool's errand.”
