Primes get rarer the larger numbers get because there are more composits and primes before them to make the mless likely, but the odd thing is that this would appear to have a discrete pattern, but it wouldnt be so, if primes truly are influenced by the amount of numbers before them then it is not of probability, but exsclusion, the larger the numbes get the more primes are excluded, this is given that these new numbers are after a set of numbers that can be divisors, so think of it this way, 2, 3 ,5 are all prime, and they also exclude othe rnumbers from being prime by theer existance, so by 3s existance and 5s existance in the number line more numbers cannot be prime, knowing this what can we do?
