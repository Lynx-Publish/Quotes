As humans we aren't afraid of death, we are afraid of the unknown, yet we must learn to accept that life carries just as many unknowns as death does, as neither provides us any form of certainty, and neither is any less paradoxical than the other. We live in a form that is in equal measure to death in oddity. We are afraid of acknowledging this, yet it is as important to understand this fact as to understand that one is alive, as you never quite know when this will not be the case.
