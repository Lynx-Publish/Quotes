Any linear system of numbers can be explained by a simple line, any alternating set of numbers can be explained by sin, cos, or something of the sort, any growing one can be explained by log or exponential growth, but what of cases of chaotic placement of numbers, such as [1, 9, 0, 5, 7], given that there is no simple transformations to make one into the next, into the next we will look at them compared to an index. Such that 1, is related to 1, 9 is related to 2, 0 is related to 3, and so on, now let's attempt to solve with these two systems, well give how the number lien works, and euclidean space if we put these in a standard geometry of euclidean space there is no solution. But, if we place them in a non-euclidean space, and then edit the shape of the space, such as modified spherical space that combines multiple spheres and other shapes, or other odd spaces and sizes and such we should be able to create a space where these numbers match up to there indexes, then by reversing this we would go back to our original numbers, as well as this wee could extrapolate in the custom non-euclidean space to another index further to predict the next value in the sequence, which is how we can solve for chaotic systems.
